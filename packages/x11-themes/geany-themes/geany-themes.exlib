SUMMARY="A collection of color schemes for Geany"
DESCRIPTION="
geany-themes is a set of color schemes containing some really nice themes. I have ported almost
all of the existing Geany themes I could find.

Some of the new themes were ported from the gedit-themes and I plan to eventually port the rest
of them. There is also a bunch of available themes for vim and TextMate that would also be nice
to port.

You can create your own theme by using one of the existing themes as a starting point and there
is more information in the Geany Manual. No programming skills are required at all to create
your own theme.
