SUMMARY="A program that implements the Host (PC) side of the USB DFU (Universal Serial Bus Device Firmware Upgrade) protocol"
DESCRIPTION="
In the Openmoko project, we use this program to communicate with our specially enhanced bootloader,
which implements the DFU device side.

Using dfu-util and your smartphone, you can:
- transfer and flash partitions in internal NAND Flash.
- transfer anything into RAM
    this can be used for fast development cycles of low-level code such as kernels without flashing them
- read out the current internal NAND partitions
    this is an easy and efficient way of doing full backups of your phone
